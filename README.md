# Poodle-Collector

My vast wisdom I've accrued over the years of my poodle collection is unbound. I've searched far and wide in my search of the perfect poodles and I've found two. These perfect specimens have cuteness indexes too colossal to expose to the rest of the world. Only I have the experience and knowledge to contain these two creatures so that they might not wreak havoc upon the world. I'm the only one with the aptitude to carry this burden. Do not attempt to find me. None shall dare to encroach on my domain.

I am the poodle collector.
